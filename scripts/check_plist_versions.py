"""Reject Info.plist files that hardcode a version instead of referencing the build setting.

A literal here silently wins over MARKETING_VERSION, so the project and the shipped bundle can
disagree. That is how the Quick Look app was still stamped 0.1 after the release had moved on --
a mismatch the notarization broker only caught at signing time, well after CI had gone green.

Invoked by CI. Uses plistlib rather than plutil so it runs on Linux too.
